Methodology
This is a strategy that should work across multiple time frames depending on the asset being traded. BTC for example works best with this strategy on the 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, and 4h
The hold time (time a position is open) increases significantly for each level up on time frame
The methodology of the strategy is based on the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Description below.

When price makes a lower low while the AO makes a higher low, this is a bullish signal.
When price makes a higher high while the AO makes a lower high, this is a bearish signal
The signals that are being followed, meaning bearish or bullish, should depend on the perceived greater trend
In a strong uptrending market a bearish signal on the 5m might make a decent short scalp while a bullish signal has much more promise for potential gains and the potential to be the beginning of a very big upward move


Entry
As described in the methodology section above, the system provides both bearish and bullish signals
Entry of a position would depend on a divergence being confirmed


Confirmation of a signal is when the second pivot in AO is locked in price close
Once a signal is confirmedâ€¦. There are some options on how we want to enter
Market order
we shouldn't really use these for anything besides stop-loss orders
Limit order
Place entry limit order at last trade price of asset
We can discuss other options
Risk Management (stop loss)

Risk management involves limiting our risk to a predefined size per trade
Risk management for the strategy should vary for the selected time frame
Invalidation of a signal of a bullish AO divergence occurs when price proceeds to make a new low after signal confirmation (and presumably entry)
With this in mind we can consistently use the assets lowest price +/- one tick (maybe from the last 5 periods) as the point we want to place our stop-loss order
The stop loss order will vary in % for every trade
What makes our risk management consistent is our position size, or how much of our collateral we are betting with on a trade by trade basis
The calculations for this are as follows:
Assume we are trading with $100,000
We want to long asset X at the last trade price of $100
Invalidation is at $84 so 16% away from our entry
The maximum amount of our portfolio we want to risk is 1% or $1000
We calculate the position size that is appropriate based off our desired risk with the following formula:
((1/stop loss size in %)*(account size*max risk))
Using out example:
((1/.16)*(100,000*.01)
((1/.16)*1000)
6250 = position size

Stop-loss orders should be market orders because in extreme volatility our exit may not get filled leaving us stuck in an invalidated trade

Exit Target
As a general rule we want our successful trades to provide 3:1 risk to reward ratio (R)
This would mean that for every 1% of risk we have 3% of potential gains on out exit order
The optimal R may change depending on the asset and timeframe
Keeping in mind the logic behind our risk management:
Consider our stop loss is 1.2% away from our entry price, we would want the take profit order to be 3.6% away from our entry price
There are some other ideas behind choosing an exit target that can be explored and optimization might change depending on asset timeframe and overall market conditions
